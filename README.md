# Density-dependent private benefit leads to bacterial mutualism
This work will be published in the Evolution journal 

Microorganisms produce and secrete materials which are beneficial for themselves and their neighbors. We modeled the situation when cells can produce different costly secretions which increase the carrying capacity of the population. Strains that lose the function of producing one or more secretions avoid the cost of production and can exhaust the producers. However, secreting substances provides a private benefit for the producers in a density-depen\-dent way. We developed a model to examine the outcome of the selection among different type of producer strains from the non-pro\-ducer strain to the partial producers, to the full producer one. We were interested in circumstances under which selection maintains partners that produce complementary secreted materials thus forming an interdependent mutualistic interaction. We show that interdependent mutualism is selected under broad range of conditions if private benefit decreases with density. Selection frequently causes the coexistence of more and less generalist cooperative strains, thus cooperation and exploitation co-occur. Interdependent mutualism is evolved under more specific circumstances if private benefit increases with density and these general observations are valid in a well-mixed  and in a structured deme model. We show that the applied population structure  allows the invasion of rare cooperators and supports cooperation in general.

# Matlab models
These models evaluates diferent parameters for the studying of the evolution of cooperation. Analitical and numerical simulations where done with the models. 

# Getting started

First make sure you have installed Communications Toolbox and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox apps in Matlab. 

# Initial conditions

Define lambda to evaluate different levels of genetic mixing. You can also change the number of subpopulations in the Creating subpopulations section and the number of cycles (n) in the Structured population cycle.

# Running the model
Make sure to save your data with the correct file name. Then run the model.

# Wolfram Mathematica models

These models create bifurcation diagrams from 1 trait and 2 traits models. 
Run the code in the Wolfram notebook to generate the diagrams. The data comes from simulations done with Matlab models.
